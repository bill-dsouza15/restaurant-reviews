# restaurant-reviews

I created this project during my 6<sup>th</sup> semester for exploring sentiment analysis using python. I have previously worked on sentiment analysis of tweets in rapid miner. [Link Here : https://github.com/bill-dsouza15/coursework-practicals/tree/main/Sem%20V/BIDA/A3/3B]

This is a simple web application in which the user enters a single-line review for the service at a restaurant and the sentiment for the review is then displayed on screen. While the only output displayed is the sentiment of the review, the application is designed to look like a chatbot just because it looks good.

* Frontend : HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript
* Backend : Flask, Python

Sample output for both positive and negative reviews
