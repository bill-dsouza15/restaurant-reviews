# Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews

I created this project during my 6<sup>th</sup> semester for exploring sentiment analysis using python. I have previously worked on sentiment analysis of tweets in rapid miner. [Link Here : https://github.com/bill-dsouza15/coursework-practicals/tree/main/Sem%20V/BIDA/A3/3B]

This is a simple web application in which the user enters a single-line review for the service at a restaurant and the sentiment for the review is then displayed on screen. Along with the sentiment, the model accuracy and the predicted value for the review is also displayed.

I designed the application to look like a chatbot so that it feels more "realistic".
